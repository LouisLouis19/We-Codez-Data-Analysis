            >1. Which countries produce the most successful athletes across
            different disciplines?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          How do we clean and process the data to determine which countries have
          the highest number of athletes excelling in various disciplines,
          factoring in missing or inconsistent country data and discipline
          classifications?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >2. How does the success rate of athletes vary with age?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          What trends can be identified when analyzing how age correlates with
          success across different sports disciplines, considering outliers,
          missing birthdates, and the need to standardize the calculation of age
          from inconsistent date formats?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >3. How do physical attributes like height and weight correlate with
            success in different sports disciplines?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          How can we clean the height and weight columns, handle outliers, and
          then analyze how these physical attributes contribute to performance
          in different sports?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >4. How do athletes' birthplaces and residence locations influence
            their success?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          What patterns can be identified between where athletes are born versus
          where they reside and their success in different sports, considering
          missing and inconsistent location data?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >5. How does the presence of sporting relatives impact an athlete’s
            performance and career longevity?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          How do we clean and process the sporting_relatives column, considering
          multiple entries and missing data, and analyze the effect of having
          relatives in sports on an athlete’s success?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >6. Is there a significant correlation between the number of years
            an athlete has been in their sport and their success?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          How can we clean and process data around athletes' start dates or
          career lengths (if available) and link this to their performance,
          adjusting for missing or inconsistent information?
        </p>

        <p>

      <h2>3. Data Science Jobs Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        Identify and list out the issues present in the data, then list out the
        steps you would take to clean this dataset. Utilize the guiding
        questions below to provide your analysis of the cleaned data, feel free

        questions.

        <summary>Guiding Questions</summary>
        <p>
          <strong
            >1. How do salary estimates compare across different company sizes,
            adjusting for outliers and inconsistent salary formats?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This requires cleaning the Salary Estimate column to extract numeric
          values, dealing with ranges, adjusting for outliers, and mapping the
          salary to company sizes across inconsistent formats.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >2. What trends can be observed between company ratings and the job
            titles offered by companies, accounting for inconsistencies in job
            title naming conventions?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This requires grouping and standardizing job titles that may have
          slight variations, then correlating them with company ratings while
          addressing missing or misleading ratings.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >3. How does job location (city/state) impact salary, considering
            both location data inconsistencies and salary formatting
            issues?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Cleaning Location and Salary Estimate columns will be necessary,
          standardizing city and state data, and resolving salary discrepancies,
          including ranges and estimated values.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >4. How do factors like industry and sector correlate with company
            success, using revenue as a proxy, considering missing and vague
            revenue data?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Requires cleaning the Revenue column, standardizing formats (e.g.,
          ranges, missing values, and ambiguous entries like "Unknown"), and
          performing multi-variable analysis across Industry and Sector.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >5. How does the year a company was founded correlate with its
            rating, industry, and revenue, after handling missing or erroneous
            founding years and dealing with categorical data issues?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This involves cleaning the Founded column to address missing,
          incorrect, or nonsensical founding years and analyzing how older
          versus newer companies perform across multiple dimensions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >6. How do salary estimates differ for the same job title between
            companies of different ownership types, requiring extensive data
            cleaning across both salary and company ownership data?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Cleaning Type of ownership and Salary Estimate is necessary to ensure
          consistent categories and formats, followed by cross-analysis between
          these variables.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >7. What influence do competitors listed in the dataset have on the
            success of a company, in terms of salary and rating, considering
            missing and incomplete competitor data?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Cleaning the Competitors column (e.g., missing data, entries like -1,
          multiple competitors in one field) will be essential before
          correlating this information with salary, ratings, and company
          performance.

            sentiment data?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This requires cleaning the Published At column to ensure consistent
          date formats, handling missing sentiment values, and performing
          temporal analysis across different sources.

        </p>
        <p>
          Cleaning the Title and Description fields to remove irrelevant
          information and standardize terms is needed before performing a topic
          modeling analysis to identify common topics per sentiment category.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >3. How do sentiment distributions vary by news type (e.g.,
            Business, Sports, Politics), after addressing missing or ambiguous
            news type entries?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Cleaning the Type column, ensuring consistent categorization of news
          types, and analyzing sentiment distributions across these categories
          will be required.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >4. How does the author’s identity correlate with sentiment trends
            across articles, considering missing or ambiguous author
            data?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Cleaning the Author column, resolving missing entries, and
          standardizing names are needed to explore the correlation between
          specific authors and the sentiment they tend to express in their
          articles.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >5. How does the time of publication influence the sentiment of news

          publication time (e.g., morning vs. evening) affects sentiment trends.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >6. Which sources are the most polarizing (i.e., have the most
            extreme sentiment distributions), considering missing data and
            duplicate entries?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
